# Flappy Nick Game
This is a flappy bird clone created using Unity 6

If you would like to play the game, run the application "./Flappy Nick Game/FlappyNick"

If you would like to only download the game, and not the related code, you can download just the "./Flappy Nick Game" folder, and  running the "FlappyNick" application found within. 

NOTE: You cannot just use the "FlappyNick" application, as it has dependencies found within the folder
NOTE: Due to file size restrictions, a library folder with many development elements are not uploaded. If you are looking to view everything, you may need to open the folder via Unity Hub so any relevant files can be regenerated.
